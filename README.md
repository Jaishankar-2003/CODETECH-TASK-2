## Project Overview: Basic Vulnerability Scanner

### Project Objective
To develop a Python-based tool capable of identifying common network and system vulnerabilities, such as open ports, outdated software versions, and potential misconfigurations. The tool will provide basic security assessments to help users identify potential risks within their network or systems.

### Key Activities
* **Vulnerability Identification:** Define a scope of common vulnerabilities to target, including open ports, outdated software, and potential misconfigurations.
* **Scanning Methodology:** Develop algorithms and techniques for scanning network hosts and services.
* **Data Collection:** Implement methods to gather information about scanned systems, including open ports, software versions, and service banners.
* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Create logic to identify potential vulnerabilities based on collected data and predefined criteria.
* **Report Generation:** Design output formats to present scan results, including identified vulnerabilities and recommendations.

### Expected Outcomes
* A functional Python-based vulnerability scanner capable of identifying basic vulnerabilities.
* Enhanced security awareness through identification of potential risks.
* A foundation for further development of more sophisticated vulnerability assessment capabilities.
